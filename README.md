# Sign_Language_Detection_Using_Action_Recognition
I developed a real-time ASL alphabet recognition system using Python, MediaPipe, and Jupyter. Utilizing neural networks for accurate gesture classification, it achieves high accuracy by filtering gestures and handling signing style variations. Despite lighting challenges, it enhances accessibility and communication for ASL users.
